# The-Impact-of-Input-Types-on-Smart-Contract-Vulnerability-Detection-using-deep-learning

a Multiple Input Model (MIM) to detection smart contract vulnerabilities with a deep learning model referred to as Convolution Neural Networks (CNN). The MIM model consists four popular input techniques, namely, Word2Vec, FastText, Bag of Words (BoW), and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). The primary objective is to identify the most efficient input technique for detecting each vulnerabilities.


The code will be available as soon as the paper is published.
