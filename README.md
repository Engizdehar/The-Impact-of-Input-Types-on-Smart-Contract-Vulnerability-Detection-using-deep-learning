"The Impact of Input Types on Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection Performance Based on Deep Learning: A Preliminary Study"
This paper addresses that gap by experimenting with four common input types: Word2Vec, FastText, Bag-of-Words (BoW), and Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).
Using convolutional neural networks for consistency, the study compared the performance of these input types in detecting vulnerabilities using a public dataset. 
The results indicate that TF-IDF is the most effective input type overall, achieving the highest F1 score and accuracy in binary classifications for most vulnerability types, and performing nearly as well as BoW in multiclass classification.

how do you run the code:

(for binary classification)
1- pick any datset from the six dataset manually (using Parser.py)
2- python my_train.py 
 
  
  (for multiclass classification):
  1-pick the multiclass data set which is (dataset_multiclass) from Parser.py
  2- python multi_class_train.py
