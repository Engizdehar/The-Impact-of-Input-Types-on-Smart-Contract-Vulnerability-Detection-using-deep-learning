"The Impact of Input Types on Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection Performance Based on Deep Learning: A Preliminary Study"

Ensuring the security of decentralized applications requires detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts before deployment. Numerous tools and machine-learning methods have been proposed for this purpose, as well as various input encoding methods for analyzing smart contracts. However, the impact of these encoding methods has not been systematically studied. This paper addresses that gap by experimenting with four common input types: Word2Vec, FastText, Bag-of-Words (BoW), and Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). Using convolutional neural networks for consistency, the study compared the performance of these input types in detecting vulnerabilities using a public dataset. The results indicate that TF-IDF is the most effective input type overall, achieving the highest F1 score and accuracy in binary classifications for most vulnerability types, and performing nearly as well as BoW in multiclass classification.

Here are the instructions on how to run the code for both binary and multiclass classification scenarios:

1-For Binary Classification:
Manually select any dataset from the six datasets using "Parser.py" by setting the default for that dataset
Run the command "python my_train.py"


2-For Multiclass Classification:
Manually select the multiclass dataset named "dataset_multiclass" from "Parser.py" by setting the default for dataset_multiclass
Execute the command python "multi_class_train.py"
